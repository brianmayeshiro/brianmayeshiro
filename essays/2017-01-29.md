## Introduction

What are your thoughts on configuration management? Have you ever had a problem due to the lack of effective configuration management practices?

Do you think GitHub is popular because of git? Or do you think git is popular because of GitHub?

After using Git for the past 2 years, I view configuration management as one of the most valuable tools in software development. Configuration management allows for 
so many opportunities for teams to develop software. 

I have had a problem with configuration management before, but that may have been due to problems with the softwar it was used for. When using git for projects made using Unity
(game engine), I constantly ran into problems with merging files. This is a known problem in Unity due to the large amount of binary, library, and meta files that come with
each Unity project.

I think GitHub is popular because using git through command line is more convenient as opposed to using a GUI like GitHub. Most programmers prefer the effeciency and precision
of using git through command line and GUI's are sometimes difficult to use since they perform some git commands automatically without your authorization.
