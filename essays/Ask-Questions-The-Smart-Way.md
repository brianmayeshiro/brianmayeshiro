## We’ve all been there before…

Consider the following scenario:
*A student named Dan is working on a project for his artificial intelligence class and encounters a problem with the search algorithm he’s using. After searching online and banging his head for 4 hours trying to solve the problem, Dan was unable to figure out how to make his search algorithm run correctly. He decides to ask his friends and the professor for help, but neither gave any helpful advice. At this point, Dan is panicking because his assignment is due in a week and he barely has any more time to work on the assignment before the deadline. What should he do next?*

Like most computer science students, they’ve experienced a similar stress-inducing situation like the scenario with Dan. However, Dan must go the “extra mile” and ask for help online as one of his few options left. Time is ticking and Dan needs to get help as soon as he can. So, if he wants a good chance of getting help, he needs to ask his question the “smart” way.

Regardless of whether the class was focused on databases, security, or artificial intelligence, the need to ask questions in the right way is important for obtaining a helpful answer, especially when under pressure. This is especially true for software engineers because knowing how to ask “smart” questions is a crucial component to effective communication and will save time in the long term.

## Example of a Not Smart Question
When I’m using the word “smart”, I’m referring to the methods described in [Eric Raymond’s article about asking smart questions](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). Before delving into the “smart” way to ask questions, I’d like to first provide an example from StackOverflow of how NOT to ask a question.

The following is an example of a “not smart” question under the guidelines Raymond’s article:  
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1669/learning-to-write-a-compiler

## Why it’s “not smart”
There were many reasons for this question not being smart, but here are some of the main ones:

-	Way too vague
-	Question had way too much depth
-	Did not show attempt to even google some sources
-	Response was “big list of resources”
-	Stack Overflow even closed the thread with...

<blockquote> "Questions asking us to recommend or find a tool, library or favorite off-site resource are off-topic for Stack Overflow as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, describe the problem and what has been done so far to solve it." – John Saunders, Ganesh Sittampalam, Bill the Lizard </blockquote>

It was even mentioned in the “answers” section that the question was simply “way too vague” which made it hard to even provide a decent answer to the questioner. The user was asking for a solution about a topic with tons of possibilities which made the scope of the question too big.

Furthermore, the question was nowhere near concise. Luckily, the questioner got a lot of responses, but in the end, the responses weren’t very helpful because he/she made it too difficult to understand the exact problem they were facing with making a compiler. The questioner showed no prior attempt to searching online for sources which demonstrated a sense of laziness and intent for someone else to do the work for them. Funny enough, the highest-rated response on that question was from a user who answered the question with “Big List of Resources”, just proving that the way the question was asked hindered people’s ability to answer the question. Luckily for this user, the “Big List of Resources” provided some helpful information (which was hard to find on Google) to guide him/her in building a compiler. 

## Example of a Smart Question

Now here’s an example of a question asked in the “smart” way: 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array 

## Why it’s “smart”
This question just so happens to be the highest-voted question on Stack Overflow and for very good reasons:

-	Had short code samples
-	Had proof of prior attempts and showed results
-	Question(s) were concise
-	Complex question, but popular and attracted interest
-	Resulted in a response with thorough and in-depth explanation

Unlike the previous example, this user asked the question concisely and provided an explanation for what he/she has done so far.  Showing effort like this demonstrates that the user had tried to understand the concept, but couldn’t and isn’t just simply asking a “homework question” to get an answer easily. As Raymond said in his article, “those questions are for you to work out, so that you will learn from the experience.” If it was truly a homework question, the questioner should only be looking for a hint at best, but in this case, he/she was having a hard time understanding a rather complex concept: sorting algorithm runtime with sorted vs. unsorted arrays. They provided the sample code of sorting algorithms in Java and C++ to test the runtimes and narrowed down the problem to demonstrate the user’s attempt and remaining confusion on the subject.

From showing such effort, the questioner was blessed with a lengthy and detailed response that also came with visuals, sample code, and an analogy (railroad junction) to explain the concept. This was honestly the most effort I came across from an answer on StackOverflow, but it proves that asking the question in the right way can yield a good response. The answerer explained the reasoning behind different runtimes for different arrays and I too learned something new from reading his response when I didn’t even expect it! It just goes to show that there will always be something to learn.

## Insights Gained as a Result of This Experience
Reading Raymond’s article and searching online for examples of questions for both ends of the spectrum gave me a better understanding of how to effectively communicate with other technical professionals for help. As for our student, Dan, if he takes some of the advice presented in Raymond’s article and use it as a guide, he will likely get the help he urgently needs.
