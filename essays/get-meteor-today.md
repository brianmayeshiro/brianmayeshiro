Tired of having to refresh your webpage every time just to see the changes you made to your code? Don’t have the time or resources to set up your own server or database for your application needs? Well I’ve got the solution for you…

Hi, Brian here and I’m going to talk to you about **Meteor**: the latest buzz in JavaScript frameworks! 

Meteor comes with a vast range of tools like semantic UI and MongoDB, all being run using npm and nodejs. With all these tools at your disposal, Meteor takes care of the painstaking work for you and lets you (the programmer) focus on coding!

## Setup can be easy as 1, 2, 3...4, 5! (maybe more steps)
If you’re a Mac or Linux user you can simply follow the instructions here, but if you’re a Windows user you might need to do the following:
1.	Disable windows real time protection or any other virus scanners 
2.	Remind yourself to turn it back on later
3.	Change the windows association for .js files from Windows Script Host to IntelliJ (for IntelliJ users)
4.	Use Ubuntu on Windows
5.	If all else fails, consider switching to a Linux OS or buying a Mac

Once you install meteor you might want to consider [doing the following in here](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s17/morea/meteor-2/reading-meteor-tips.html) to help troubleshoot potential problems.
Now that you have Meteor properly installed, all you need to do now is create an app directory in your desired project and run meteor npm install. More steps may also be required, as described in here, but once everything is set up in your project, you are now use Meteor in all its showery greatness!
Through Meteor, you can create a query/schema with ease through the Mongo database that comes with installation. This gets rid of the hassle of having to create your own SQL database and apply SQL functions on top of your JavaScript, CSS, and HTML code.
When you’re ready to test your application, in your app directory, simply type meteor. Your web application should be viewable via http://localhost:3000. From here, you can view any changes you make to Meteor in real time! It’s like magic (or just some cool technical backend work to make it look like magic). Through real time webpage updates after every change, development can run much quicker and improve productivity.

## But wait, there’s more!
All of this sounds like an expensive package, but surprise! It’s not. Meteor is free and you can get it right now by going to [Meteor.com](https://www.meteor.com/). 
Through Meteor, you no longer need to deal with the hassle of setting up your 1000 things just to get a simple hello world application.

So, don’t get yourself hit with an asteroid sized problem in app development, instead go with the smaller and more manageable Meteor.

#### Warning. When using Meteor, side effects may include: Hours of banging your head against the wall, regret of buying a PC, several reinstalls, long extraction times, increase use of curse words, and rage quitting. Consider talking to your doctor or psychiatrist before trying Meteor.
