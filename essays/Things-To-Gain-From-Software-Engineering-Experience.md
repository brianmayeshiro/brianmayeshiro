Learning about Software Engineering will provide me fundamental insight on how to develop programs with teams while being efficient. With the tech world moving at such a fast pace, I need to know how to develop software in a timely manner to keep up-to-date with the newest technologies that release every year. Also, group work is a large component of most large-scale software projects.  Learning how to effectively work with my teammates along with knowing how to use a proper source control system like Git is highly beneficial for anyone that’s interested in developing software.

In the future, I hope to develop a stronger work ethic when programming for large projects. With no prior experience working on a project with a substantial amount of code, I need to learn how to develop a sense of discipline when working on such large and time-consuming projects. Large projects make it difficult for a person or team to stay focused because it’s a huge investment of time and resources. 

## In the worst case, it might not work out and you need to abandon the project…

This is something common in the games industry, which so happens to be one of my main fields of interest! I’m hoping to develop a sense of accurate judgement on the value of a project (or game) so I’ll know if it’s still worth the investment. Chances are that all the software engineering skills and experiences I gain in my college career can be applied to a Game Development job. In the games industry, you are likely to be working with a team on a game 99% of the time if you’re part of any game company. Before I graduate, I hope to develop the necessary skills and background in software engineering to prepare for my post-college career in Computer Science.
