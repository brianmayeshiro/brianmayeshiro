Learning about Software Engineering will provide me fundamental insight on how to develop programs with teams and do it efficiently. With the tech world moving at such a fast pace, I need to know how to develop software in a timely manner to keep up-to-date with the newest technologies that release every year. Also, a big component of software engineering in the modern industry is group work. Learning how to effectively work with my teammates along with knowing how to use a proper source control system like Git is highly beneficial for my career.

In the future I hope to develop a strong work ethic when programming for large projects. With no prior experience working on a project with a lot of code yet, I need to learn how to develop a sense of discipline when working on such time-consuming projects. Large projects make it difficult for a person or team to stay focused because it is a huge investment of time and resources and sometimes it doesn’t work out…

Chances are that all the software engineering skills I learn throughout my college career can be applied to a Game Development job. In the games industry, you are likely to be working with a team on a game 99% of the time if you’re part of a major game company. Before I graduate, I hope to develop the necessary skills and background in software engineering to prepare for my future jobs in Computer Science.
