## We must insure security and stability (without being imperial)

If you’re the CEO of an airline company, you don’t want your customers being forcibly dragged off a plane. If you’re a politician, you don’t want to pass a law that will risk the lives of your people. If you’re the principal of a school, you don’t want to encourage students to start a fight every day. Like these careers and many others, ethics plays a significant role for insuring the security and safety of people in the community. Software engineering is no exception, being equally important as the security of the software. 

## The internet is the ideal environment for unethical behavior
If you could do whatever you want without any real punishment, why not do it? As opposed to “real-life”, people on the internet do not need to associate their real identity with their online one all the time. Thus, making it easier for people to harass, abuse, and threaten people online with no real fear of consequence. 
One example of such harassment is the “gamergate” problem in the gaming community. The word “gamergate” refers to discrimination towards minorities and females within the game industry. Even though this controversy began in 2014, harassment in the game industry has been around for some time. Racism and sexism has been an ongoing problem that has not improved much within the past few years. In 2016, a professional Hearthstone player who goes by the name “TerrenceM” became the (butt of racist jokes and comments in a tournament)[http://www.pcgamer.com/how-terrencems-amazing-dreamhack-hearthstone-run-was-marred-by-twitch-chat-racism/] whenever his matches were broadcasted on Twitch.tv. Emotes like “Trihard” were commonly spammed since the emote was associated with being African-American.
These jokes were racist, but they also gave a bad precedent that things like this are okay on Twitch. When making such software, not only would unethical online behavior make your software unpopular, it will cause people (like TerrenceM) to be uncomfortable with their safety around such environments. There needs to be a better form of action to discourage such behavior. 

## What could be done...
Ethical issues in “real life” are as equally important as the ethics of online behavior. I think companies need to take precautions to prevent any features that may promote such behavior. In the TerrenceM scenario, the developers of Twitch could re-evaluate emotes and remove one’s that could have a racist or sexist implication of use. For the software engineer, situations like “gamergate” raises the problems associated with anonymity in application usage. With the popularity of social media and online activity, ethics in software have become just as important as the software itself.
