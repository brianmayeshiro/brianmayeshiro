The goal of the final project in ICS 321 was to create a practical web application that demonstrated our understanding in using databases. As a result, my partner (Sheng Yuan Su) and I came up with the idea of developing an app that would help its users organize professional/recreational meetings. 

For this project my role consisted of front-end tasks such as designing the UI and configuring the buttons. 

After completing this project I learned about the complexities that can result from using databases in an application.
