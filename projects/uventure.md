As part of the Final Project assignment for this course, uVenture was an app developed by Christopher Nguyen, Jason Leong, and myself. The app was designed to assist in planning recreational gatherings for people within the UH community using the Google Maps API and background information provided by Yelp reviews. This application was developed using the JavaScript framework, Meteor, and the IntelliJ IDE for development. Once the project was ready for submission, we used Galaxy to deploy our application onto a webpage.

My role for this project was to handle the UH CAS authentication and profile page for the user account. Since this app was catered towards the UH community, only people who were in the UH system could login and create a profile for uVenture. This insured that no-one from outside of the UH community can intervene with planned adventures. Once the user successfully logs into the app, they are immediately redirected to a profile page in which they create their own profile. The profile page gives them the option of providing their social media contact information (i.e. Twitter) and email contact in the case of needing to be contacted for a specific adventure. 

I'm glad I could endure this process of developing and completing a web application with a group because it taught me how to better manage certain aspects of the development process in a group. Before taking this course, I was not aware of the variety of tools that GitHub provides for the app development process. Issues, project cards, and the visual representations of our "branches" greatly helped in making things less frustrating. I will certainly use these features for my future projects and am fortunate to learn all the methods to Software Engineering before I finish my undergraduate studies.
