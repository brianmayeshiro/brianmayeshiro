## Background
Made in [Unity C#](https://unity3d.com/) and the [Corgi Engine](http://corgi-engine.moremountains.com/), White Tulip is a 2D Puzzle Platformer about depression and PTSD. It tells a story about overcoming the symptoms of these mental illnesses in the hope of inspiring others to join the fight against mental illness and overcome the struggles that come with it.

The pre-production phase of this project begun in the Summer of 2016, where a few of my friends and I wanted to create a videogame on our spare time that we can add on our resumes. Not much progress occurred during that period and people started to leave the project due to other commitments. As a result, only myself and a friend (my writer) continued working on White Tulip.

It wasn't until the Summer of 2017 where the project would pick-up speed again and begin full-scale production. Since then, I was able to acquire the help of my writer friend and an artist.

White Tulip is expected to be completed by late 2018, in time to submit it for the [Indie Games Festival](http://www.igf.com/). All profits from White Tulip will be donated to the [American Foundation for Suicide Prevention](https://afsp.org/).
